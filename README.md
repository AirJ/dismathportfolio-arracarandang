#Week1

DisMath or Discrete Mathematics, is a subject where the only thing you have to deal with is logic.And from the comments of the higher batch or those who already took up Dismath, it is really a hard subject to pass. 

Sir Cabatuan, our professor in dismath, is an ECE professor who has traveled to a lot of countries where he contributed to their technology.

I've learned the following in our first day:

a.  Proposition- w/c is a declarative sentence; either True or False

b.  Examples on how to distinguish if the statement is a proposition or not

c.  Truth Values: T/1 (true proposition),  F/0 (false proposition) 

d.  Logical operators such as: 

  1. Conjunction (^) 
  
  -"p and q"
  
  -TRUE when both p and q are T
  
  -minimum of p and q
  
  2.Disjunction (∨) 

  -"p or q"
  
  -FALSE when both are false
  
  -maximum of p and q
  
  3.Exclusive Disjunction (⊕)
  
  -"p or q" (but not both)
  
  -TRUE if exactly one of p and q is True
  
  4.Implication (→) 
  
  - "if p, then q", etc.
  
  -TRUE when pa and q are True

  -TRUE when p is false
  
  5.Biconditional (↔) 
  
- "if and only if"
  
  -TRUE when both p and q are both True and False

  6. Negation (-) - "not p"
  
e. Truth table- it is a list of all posiible inputs/ combination of inputs w/ corresponding outputs

f. (2^n) - the formula to get the number of rows; n as the number of variables


#Week2

I've learned the following:

a. Contrapositive

  - "-q → -p"
  
  - same truth value with p→q
  
b. Inverse

  - "-p→-q"
  
c. Converse

  - "q→p"
  - 
d. Precedence of logical Operators

   (¬) - 1
   
   (^) - 2
   
   (v) - 3
   
   (→) - 4
   
   (↔) - 5
   
e. System Specifications

  - should be CONSISTENT( not conflicting requirement that could be used to contradict)

f. Propositional Equivalences

  1. Tautology (always True)

  2. Contradiction (always False)
  
  3. Contingency (neither True nor False)
  
g. Logical equivalences

  - compound proposition have same truth values in all possible cases
  
  - "p = q"
  
  - different laws:
  
  Identity Law

  Domination Law
  
  Idempotent Law
  
  Double Negation
  
  Commutative Law
  
  Associative Law
  
  Distributive Law
  
  De Morgan's Law
  
  Absorption Law
  
  Negation Law

h. Propositional Logic

  - deals w/ proposition as whole

i. Predicate Logic

  - has internal structure in terms of SUBJECT and PREDICATE

j. Quantifiers

  - indicates generality of subject/ predicate

  - kinds:

      Existential quantifier - is true if and only if P(x) is true for atleast 1 value of x in the domain

      Universal quantifier - asserts that a property is true for all values of a variable in a particular domain
